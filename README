Project 1 Writeup

For this project, we chose to write our program in Python, due to the built-in
modules in Python which allowed for relatively easy development. Originally,
we planned to use the asyncore module to develop a complex, async-capable
client to interface with the server, but there were difficulties in 
implementing the asyncore module. After reviewing the project requirements,
we determined that an asynchronous client was not necessary, and refactored
the code to no longer use the asyncore module or implement any asynchronous
handling. Instead, we use a simple iterative loop to receive the server 
message, and then calculate a response and send it.

One aspect of the project which required a considerable amount of effort was
supporting the requirement for parameterized arguments. In the python code,
the implementation was rather simple using argparse, but we had little 
experience with how to code bash scripts to support this feature. We found
an extremely helpful example at http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/035, which
we adapted into our own client bash script.

With the parameterized arguments completed, we tried to add SSL support. 
Modifying the argparse to return a boolean on <-s> for switching back and
forth between using and not using SSL was simple enough, but
wrapping the initial socket into an SSL Socket continually returned a
certificate verification error or returned nothing from the server in the
case that verification was bypassed.
